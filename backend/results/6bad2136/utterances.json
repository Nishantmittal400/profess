So, today we are going to be talking about this topic regression analysis and in this topic I am going to teach you the conceptual knowledge of regression. It is used as a multivariate analysis technique to study the interdependence between many variables. You need a dependent variable and you need many independent variables. For the dependent variable one of the prerequisite is that the dependent variable should have been captured in a metric scale. Does anyone remember what is metric scale?
